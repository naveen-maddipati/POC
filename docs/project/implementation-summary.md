- ✅ **HttpClient**: Standardized HTTP operations with interceptors

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Integration (Ready Now)
1. **Add Route**: Wire EnterpriseDemoComponent to your app routing
2. **Dashboard Link**: Add navigation to enterprise demo from main dashboard
3. **Test Operations**: Verify against your actual Nuxeo server
4. **Customize Types**: Adjust document types to match your specific setup

### Production Enhancements (Future)
1. **Authentication**: Replace demo auth with OAuth2/SAML integration
2. **Caching**: Add Redis/in-memory caching for operation responses
3. **Monitoring**: Integrate with APM tools for operation tracking
4. **Testing**: Add unit/integration tests for all enterprise operations

## 📖 Documentation Updates

### README-FUTURE-READY.md
